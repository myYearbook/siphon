Siphon is a daemon to requeue messages from ActiveMQ and put them into RabbitMQ.

In managing a migration project to move off of ActiveMQ we found we needed to use 
our RabbitMQ consumers and code prior to our ability to move our code that publishes 
into the queues.  Siphon allows us to transparently move to the new backend consumer
code while maintaining a reasonable quality of service until we can move fully off
of publishing to ActiveMQ.

Our queues in ActiveMQ are named with a namespacing pattern that matches up to RabbitMQ's
exchanges pretty well.  As such we transparently break stuff apart to build our
exchanges and queues.  If this doesn't work for you, you can set a default_exchange parameter
where the format would be Exchange: default exchange, Queue: Stomp Queue Name, 
Binding Key: default exchange.Stomp Queue Name
